              service.
              Having clearly stated and promoted values within our organisation, by which all team members are held
              accountable, is the key to our business. These values form the framework within which all major decisions
              are
              made and they provide a strong benchmark and sounding board against which any potential disagreement or
              conflict may ultimately be measured and resolved. The resulting consistency of action and the equitable
              nature
              by which decisions are made, means that there is a greater likelihood of the development of a harmonious,
              high
              performance team. There is substantial evidence to support the view that a happy team environment of
              committed
              and aligned people leads directly to the greater likelihood of outstanding customer service delivery.
